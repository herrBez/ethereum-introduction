\begin{frame}{Open Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
\item Verified compilers~\cite{towardsVerifyingEthereumSmartContract}
\item Formalize semantics of Solidity code and
a compiler from Solidity into EVM, formally proving
is soundness against the formal semantics~\cite{grishchenko2018semantic}

\item Design an efficient static analysis  technique for EVM bytecode and to formally prove its soundness against the formal sematics~\cite{grishchenko2018semantic}

\item Optimize gas consumption in generated code~\cite{bib:gas}
